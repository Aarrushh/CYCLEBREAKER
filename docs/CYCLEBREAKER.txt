 App Concept & Purpose 

 CycleBreaker SA is a digital lifeline for low-income South Africans trapped in poverty cycles. 
 Unlike generic finance apps, it delivers hyper-localized, actionable steps across all six poverty 
 pillars – turning systemic barriers into manageable tasks. By combining AI-driven resource 
 matching with crisis prevention tools, it transforms survival mode into escape planning.

 Dear Aarrush, 

 I appreciate your email regarding the idea and implementation of this supposed Cyclebreaker 
 SA app, the idea and purpose behind it are wonderful for sure, however there are some severe 
 limitations on the rollout of this app that I think are extremely pertinent and would actually be 
 quite difficult for us to deal with considering our resources and the environment we're operating 
 in. 

 Firstly, I appreciate how you approached the internet issue, since our country has oe of the 
 highest mobile data costs, amost people will simply not use data for apps like these, espeically 
 since many own phones that do not have 4g coverage. However your solution of USSD is a little 
 bit risky, because USSD provides absolutely no security, its a session with no end-to end 
 encryption, which means that anyone woth acces to network level systems like telcom 
 employees or bad actors could potentially intercept and manipulate the information that is 
 displayed and released. Because it doesn't have strong user authentication like passwords etc. 
 it means that people can submit false applicaitons, claims for grants, or people's private info can 
 get leaked and stolen. Another huge issue with USSD is that since they don't have UI 
 protection, people can get very easily scammed into fake 120break codes and access 
 fraudulent websites that mimick the legitimate services, low  media literacy environment like the 
 townships put people especially at risk for this. Also the facts that USSD cannot secure and 
 store past sessions in a local storage presents a risk for financial and health based tasks since 
 they cannot veirfy past activity which can present an massive issue. 

 However this issue with USSD is only if the app heavily relies on this fucntion so let me know. 

 Maintaining this system would be expensive, and not to even mention the absolute pain in the 
 ass it would be to get this system integrated and started up, since Integrating with government 
 systems (SASSA, NSFAS, SETA) is possilby worse than running a 50k run and then walking on 
 legos, my parents can attest to the red tape, eligibility processes and bureacracy that 
 implementing a new technology in this country can be. 

 Thirdly, another one of our biggest issues arises in the local implementation, because we are 
 running on the assumption that local pricing stays consistent, and for things like Spaza shops 
 and and transport rates, the pricings for these sectos are very much fluid and uneven (the taxi 
 industry is literally an untouchable mafia for the past couple decades). Also we have to rely on a 
 trust model for this, since we're not the first program to come in and promise the people 
 consistency in terms of finding jobs, health services etc, job postings, clinic queues, debt 
 remediation scripts must be locally relevant and continuously updated. 

 In summation, we need to make sure that these core issues are addressed, otherwise our 
 project is doomed to a lengthy and painful death, as we need to ensure we get consistent local 
 participatoon (in terms of local ambasadors, surveys etc.),  good and stable aprtnerships with 
 telecom companies, and offline storages along with regular audits and other stuff to ensure the 
 secuity of our app. 

 Overall I think it is still a great idea, however due to the massive scale this requires and the 
 amount of work needed, I feel like us being in college and having no expendable income would 
 make this considerably harder as a project without a good backer. 

 Let me know what you think and what your solutions are. 

 Kind regards, 

 Kassa
