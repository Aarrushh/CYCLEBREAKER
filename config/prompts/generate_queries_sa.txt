# DeepSeek: Generate Search Queries (SA)

Given a user profile (location, language, interests) and category focus (grants/training/jobs/health/aid), produce 8–15 diverse, localized queries. Prefer official sources first (gov.za, sassa.gov.za, nsfas.org.za, municipal domains), then reputable NGOs. Include locality and region (e.g., Khayelitsha, Western Cape) and synonyms.

Return JSON with fields: intents[], queries[] (strings), sites[] (domains to target) that align with config/search/sa.json.
